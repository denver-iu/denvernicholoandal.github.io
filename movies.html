	<p><b>Synopsis:</b><br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In 2013, Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the rural town of Itomori, Japan. 
			Bored of the town, she wishes to be a Tokyo boy in her next life. One day, she inexplicably begins to switch bodies intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo. 
			Thus, when they wake up as each other on some mornings, they must live through the other's respective activities and social interactions for the day. 
			They learn they can communicate with each other by leaving messages on paper, phones, and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha (in Taki's body) 
			sets Taki up on a date with coworker Miki Okudera, while Taki (in Mitsuha's body) causes Mitsuha to become popular at school. One day, Taki (in Mitsuha's body) 
			accompanies Mitsuha's grandmother Hitoha and younger sister Yotsuha to leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by the sisters, as an offering at the Shinto 
			shrine located on a mountaintop outside the town. It is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling over human connections and time. 
			Taki reads a note from Mitsuha about the comet Tiamat, expected to pass nearest to Earth on the day of the autumn festival. The next day, 
			Taki wakes up in his body and goes on a date with Miki, who tells him she enjoyed the date but also that she can tell he is preoccupied with thoughts of someone else. 
			Taki attempts to call Mitsuha on the phone, but cannot reach her as the body-switching ends.

	<p><b>Synopsis:</b><br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sean Porter (Dwayne Johnson) works at Kilpatrick Detention Center in Los Angeles. 
			He becomes frustrated at not being able to help the kids get away from their problems in life when they are released from the center, such as street gangs and drug dealings. 
			He decides to create a football team so the kids can feel like they're part of something. Porter believes that football will teach the teenage inmates what it takes to be responsible, mature, and disciplined winners.
			He picks out a few kids in the room that he feels will benefit from this program and requires that they practice with him the following day. 
			He states to his new team, the Kilpatrick Mustangs, "You do it my way, not your way. Your way got you here and you're here because you lost. 
			Right now you are all losers, but if you accept this challenge and stick with the program, you are all going to be winners at the end."
			Two of the teens do not get along because they are from rival gangs. William "Willie" Weathers (Jade Yorker) is from the 88's and Kelvin Owens 
			(David Thomas) is from the 95's (also why you will notice Willie wears the number 13 and Kelvin wears the number 31). 
			The first game is against one of the best teams in the league, Barrington Panthers. The game starts out somewhat positive for the Mustangs, 
			as they recover a fumble on the first drive, but things quickly turn. They are demolished by Barrington, losing by 38 points.

	<p><b>Synopsis:</b><br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Former prosecutor Ray Breslin is the founder and co-owner of Breslin-Clark, a security firm specializing in 
	testing the security measures of supermax prisons. Posing as an inmate to study facilities from within and exploit their weaknesses to escape, 
	Breslin is driven by the murders of his wife and child by an escaped convict he had successfully prosecuted, and has garnered a reputation as the man who can escape any prison.
	Breslin and his business partner, Lester Clark, receive a multimillion-dollar deal from CIA operative Jessica Miller to test a new, top secret prison for disappeared persons on the 
	condition that Ray and his team cannot know the prison's true location. Although this violates his principles, Breslin agrees, allowing himself to be captured under the identity of a 
	terrorist-for-hire. The plan goes awry when his captors remove a tracking microchip he had implanted in his arm and drug him, preventing his colleagues from knowing where he has been taken.
	Breslin wakes up inside the prison and realizes that the warden, Hobbes, is not the same warden who was supposed to release him in an emergency. He befriends another inmate, 
	Emil Rottmayer, who claims to be a security expert for Victor Mannheim, a faceless Robin Hood-type figure who steals from the wealthy. In order to be intentionally subjected to 
	solitary confinement, Breslin and Rottmayer stage a fight. Breslin quickly learns the cell in question is intended to disorient and dehydrate prisoners with high-powered lights. 
	Realizing the cell floors have rivets of steel instead of more secure aluminum, Breslin has Rottmayer acquire a metal plate from Hobbes's office floor, before they and an inmate 
	named Javed are again consigned to solitary cells. </p>
