    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College years or being a college life<sup>1</sup>. 
	I think college life is all about exploring things and making memories<sup>2</sup>. 
	And the most interesting thing about college life is that we are stuck in between our childhood<sup>3</sup>. 
	My college life starts in the middle of the pandemic<sup>4</sup>. A time that all schools are online class set up<sup>5</sup>. 
	But even though we are in that situation, I feel like were in college years or college life<sup>6</sup>. 
	Online class setup is very different from face-to-face <sup>7</sup>. Times that I can’t meet my classmates<sup>8</sup>. 
	It’s difficult to make memories with my classmates<sup>9</sup>. Bonding with them on stressful days<sup>10</sup>. 
	There was a time that my classmates set a meeting, even if we never met once because of the pandemic<sup>11</sup>. 
	And I realized we’re on college life<sup>12</sup>. Another achievement of our life, but also a new challenge for us<sup>13</sup>. 
	And then the UE announce that we will be having a face-to-face in the second semester<sup>14</sup>. 
	It’s sad but also, I’m glad to be back in UE and meet my classmates<sup>15</sup>. 
	Lots of lessons to be learned in college life<sup>16</sup>. You can see the joy and do not drain yourself or pressure<sup>17</sup>. 
	Just look around and make memories in college life, it’s fun<sup>18</sup>. 
	So, in this amazing phase of our life, we should enjoy life fearlessly and work really hard for our bright future<sup>19</sup>. 
	And these are a few stories of my college years<sup>20</sup>.
